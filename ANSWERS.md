ASSIGNMENT 2- INTRO TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

1.  Software Engineering and how it differs from tradional programming:
    answers:
Software engineering is the application of engineering methods, principles and tools in the design, development, testing, use and maintenance software systems and appications.
It differs from traditional programming in that.
Software engineeering involves the whole lifecycle of planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance, documentation, and quality assurance of software systems.
While traditional programming only focuses on writing codes to solve an identified problem.


2.  Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
    answers:
(a) requirements -gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements.
(b) designing - drafting a detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
(c) implementation - this phase involves writing code and building the software according to the specifications on the design.
(d) testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software perform to expectation, and thats it meet the standard and functionality.
(e) release - deploying the software  to clients.
(f) maintenance - releasing updates, support and patching to enhancing the software.



3.  Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
    answers:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development which focuses on flexibility, customer collaboration and delivering small functional pieces of software quicky.
While waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, it incorporates phases from software requirements, designing, implementation, testing, deploying  and maintenance of the applications and softwares.
Once a phase is competed in waterfall, it is hard to change it as one move to the next phase, while in agile, as it is iterative, there may be many revists on a certain aspect of the program to alter it to accomodate user needs.

Appication areas:
Waterfall may be preferred where requirements are understood and changes are unlikely to occur.
Agile is applied in project requiring dynamic changes. 



4.  Requirements engineering. Process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    answers:
Requirement engineering is a process that involves identifying, documenting and managing the requirements of a software.

The process of requirement engineering include:
(a) requirement generation through gathering information
(b) requirement analysis to refine and explain the gathered information or requirements.
(c) requirement specification for documenting purpose of the gathered requirements in a structural format.
(d) requirement validation to ensure that the requirements meet are correct.
(e) requirement management.

importance of requirement engineering
(a) for clear understating of needs
(b) improves planning and estimations
(c) help in risk mitigation
(d) help in quality assurance



5.  Software Design Principles: modularity and how does it improve maintainability and scalability.
    answers:
Modularity is a principle that divides software system into different components that perform distinct functions.
Modularity improves maintainability in that, as module are self-contained, changes made on one part do not affect the whole software, thus it becomes easy to debug and test features in softwares.
Also in terms of scalability, teams can work on separate modules at same time, this cuts on time used to develop application and also it bring about better utilization of resources.



6.  Different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    answers:
(a) unit testing- involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure that it operates to the expectations.
(b) intergrating testing - this focuses on interaction between related modules to ensure they work in coherance as intended.
(c) system testing - this focuses on testing the whole application or software.
(d) acceptance testing - this is done to assess whether the software is ready for release by comparing it with user needs or business requirements.

importance of testing:
(a) it helps to deliver quality software.
(b) it improves security on the software.
(C) it  enhances performance and usability of the software.
(d) it reduces risks of software failure.



7. Version Control Systems: Important in software development. Popular version control systems and their features.
    answers:
version control are software tools that help in recording changes made to files by keeping track on their modified code.
importance of version control systems:
(a) version control allow multiple developers to work on same projects concurrently without overwriting each other's changes, this facilitates efficient teamwork and collaboration.
(b) VCS serve as a backup system, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if a new change has issues.

examples of version control system and their features:
Git - has distributed architecture, supports branching and merging, has staging areas.
Subversion - contain centralized repository, directory versioning, locking mechanism.
Mercurial - efficient handling of large project, distributed architecture.


8.   Role of a software project manager. key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
    answers:
A software engineer is tasked with the role of planning, executing, and overseeing software development projects to ensure they meet the defined objectives, timelines and budgets.

key responsibilities:
(a) project planning.
(b) team management.
(c) risk management.
(d) progress monitoring and reporting.
(e) quality assurance.

challenges faced in managing software projects.
(a) unclear and  undefined expectations.
(b) time constraint.
(c) poor communication.
(d) project cancellation.



9.   Software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
    answers:
Software maintenance is art or process of modyfing and updating software after it has been deployed.
types of maintenance include:
(a) corrective maintenance - focuses on fixing bugs and defects found in the software and also patching security issues.
(b) adaptive maintenance - to make software comply with system changes and be able to run without issues.
(c) perfective maintenance - carried out to improve the functionality of software in terms of performance.
(4)  preventive maintenance - perfomed to prevent future problems and to improve software maintanability.

Maintenance is essential in software in that:
(a) it ensures longevity and usability of software.
(b) improves quality and performance.
(c) it addresses security concerns.
(d) it help retain user satisfaction.



10.   Ethical issues that software engineers might face. How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work.
    answers:
ethical issues include:
(a) privacy concerns on collecting,storing and sharing user data.
(b) security concerns on user safety.
(c) transparency concerns on software capabilities and limitations.
(d) bias and fairness in algorithms that may perpetuate unfair treatment of certain groups of individuals.
(d) professional responsiblities on production of quality and reliable software.

how software engineers can adhere to ethical standards:
(a) Adopting a code of ecthics in their work.
(b) Incorporate privacy principles into the design and development process.
(c) Follow indudtrisl best practice to ensure protection of user data.
(d) Being transparent about the capabilities of the software.
(e) Quality assurance through various testing on the performance and functionality of the software.
